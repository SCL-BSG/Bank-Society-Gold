Bank Society Coin Masternode Install Guide - Setup Guide (Single VPS/IP)
========================================================================

Important : Never try to setup a Masternode on the same domain as your wallet, as this will
            never work. THe Masternode concept requires a UNIQUE node IP. THerefore, a VPS
            (Virtual Private Server) is the cheapest way to implement a Masternode. 

Masternode Rewards Information
------------------------------


To setup a masternode you will first need 20,000 SOCI, a Virtual Private Server and a Society-qt (GUI Wallet). A small amount of technical knowledge is required to follow the setup guide below.

A masternode is a combination of two seperate wallets. A Controller and slave wallet setup ensures secure storage of your collateral. A VPS (slave) wallet will be configured to allow your GUI controller wallet to communicate and exchange information. The controller wallet must remain unlocked and connected through the Society network to your slave (VPS) at all times for active status. It's recommended to setup your controller wallet on a computer that only you have physical access to, behind a firewall, running linux or Windows with a good anti-virus.

A VPS wallet will be configured to allow your GUI controller wallet to communicate and exchange information. The controller wallet must remain connected through the Society network to your VPS at all times for active status.

This means that the master wallet must be open and connected to receive Masternode rewards.


============
== STEP 1 ==
============

Setup your controller wallet - this will keep your coins safe.
Install Society-qt on Windows or Linux from the official releases. 

Load your Society-qt wallet and sync.
Shut-down Society-qt
Find your society.conf file Help - Debug - Information - Click society.conf button under Troubleshooting or browse c:\Users\username\AppData\LocalRoaming\Society  (windows) or home/username/.Society/ (Linux)
Edit society.conf with notepad or gedit/nano


Add the following line:

addnode=your_VPS_server_IP

Save and exit

Load Society-qt wallet and sync.

Backup your private keys and wallet file!

============
== STEP 2 ==
============

Create your Masternode Collateral.

Click "Receive" and generate a new address with the label "Masternode 1"
Send exactly 20000 Society to this address and wait for confirmations.

============
== STEP 3 ==
============

Open the Debug Console.

Click Help on the top file menu
Click Console on the top Tab Bar

============
== STEP 4 ==
============

Generate your Private Key & and Outputs

In the debug console command box (bottom of screen) enter the following:

masternode genkey {ENTER}
masternode outputs {ENTER}

You should see something very similar to this (save into a text file in Notepad or Gedit/Nano/etc):

masternode genkey
05040h0f9fdju3n9g9dsnwpx9g3nasz9dgnas

masternode outputs￼
{
"29a839eca6be6f1f0656cb23ed04f824ddb72f19bf9168a0c5b5243eae34d765" : "0",
}

Close your debug window

============
== STEP 5 ==
============

Configure your controller wallet (masternode.conf - recommended):

Open masternode.conf in Notepad or Gedit/Nano

Add the following information:
alias your_VPS_server_IP:23960 PRIVATEKEY TXT_HASH TXT_INDEX

An example:
mn1 your_VPS_server_IP:23960 05040h0f9fdju3n9g9dsnwpx9g3nasz9dgnas 29a839eca6be6f1f0656cb23ed04f824ddb72f19bf9168a0c5b5243eae34d765 0

Configure your controller wallet (GUI):

On the Menu bar click "Masternodes"
Click the Tab "My Masternodes"
Click the "Create" button
Alias: MN1
Address: your_VPS_server_IP:23960
PrivKey: 05040h0f9fdju3n9g9dsnwpx9g3nasz9dgnas
TxHash: 29a839eca6be6f1f0656cb23ed04f824ddb72f19bf9168a0c5b5243eae34d765
Output: 0

Click "OK" now open up an SSH client Putty

Step #6:

Register & Log in to your Linux VPS as root. Ubuntu or Debian is recommended.

Step #7: [VPS/Putty]

Install the required wallet dependencies:

su
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade
apt-get install build-essential
apt-get install libssl-dev
apt-get install libboost-all-dev
apt-get install libqrencode-dev
apt-get install libgmp3-dev
apt-get install libgmp-dev
apt-get install miniupnpc
apt-get install libminiupnpc-dev
apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
apt-get install dh-autoreconf
apt-get install autoconf
apt-get install automake
apt-get install git nano
apt-get install pkg-config
apt-get install libtool
apt-get install software-properties-common

Install Berkley DB 4.8 (Automatically)

su
add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin
apt-get update
apt-get install libdb4.8-dev libdb4.8++-dev

Download and manually compile Berkley DB 4.8 (If above fails)

cd ~
mkdir bitcoin
mkdir bitcoin/db4
wget 'http://download.oracle.com/berkeley-db/db-4.8.30.NC.tar.gz'
tar -xzvf db-4.8.30.NC.tar.gz
cd db-4.8.30.NC/build_unix/
../dist/configure --enable-cxx --disable-shared --with-pic --prefix=~/bitcoin/db4
make install

Download and manually compile Berkley DB 5+ (If DB 4.8 won't install or compile)

apt-get install libdb-dev libdb++-dev

Step #8: [VPS/Putty]

Create Swap Space:

su
fallocate -l 3G /swapfile
dd if=/dev/zero of=swapfile bs=1M count=3072
mkswap /swapfile
chmod 600 /swapfile
swapon /swapfile
echo -e "/swapfile none swap sw 0 0 \n" >> /etc/fstab
cat /proc/meminfo

If you get an error: "operation not permitted" please see here for a possible fix.

Step #9: [VPS/Putty]

Build & compile the slave wallet binary:

git clone https://github.com/profithunterscoin/phc
cd phc/src
make -f makefile.unix
cp phcd /usr/bin
cd ..

Step #10: [VPS/Putty]

Create your configuration File:

mkdir /root/.Society
nano /root/.Siciety/society.conf

Copy and paste the following (Slave wallet only):

rpcuser=society_edit_me
rpcpassword=pass_edit_me
listen=1
server=1
daemon=1
logtimestamps=1
shrinkdebugfile=1
masternode=1
maxconnections=256
externalip=server_ip:23960
masternodeaddr=server_ip:23960
masternodeprivkey=replace_me

Modify the above information:

Change society_edit_me to a username or leave default
Change pass_edit_me to a secure password (random is recommended)
Replace server_ip with your VPS address
Replace_me with your private key from Step #4:

Save and exit (CTRL + X):

Press: Y then ENTER to overwrite.

Step #12: [VPS/Putty]

Start your slave wallet:

societyd

If it looks like it's just sitting there idle on the last step try using:

societyd getinfo

Wait until full sync - try the above commands periodically to view the progress:

If you close Putty and societyd exits too: Install screen (apt-get install screen) and run it using: screen societyd

Step #13: [VPS/Putty]

Remote Start your masternode:

In your controller wallet (GUI) click "Masternodes"
Click the "My Masternodes" tab
Click "Update"
If you see your masternode slave-wallet VPS IP - excellent!
Then click "Start All"
Once again "Update"
You should see "Masternode is running..."
Over a short-period of time it will show up in the Society network tab

Step #14:

You might want to install MNChecker but this is optional.

Close Putty:
